# Customer Behavior Data Analysis (SQL, Python, Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to understand purchasing patterns, trends, and customer insights that can support business decision-making and marketing strategies.

## Repository Structure

```

## Technologies Used
- SQL for querying, filtering, and transforming raw data
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step documentation and analysis
- Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop
- SQL environment or tool to execute .sql scripts

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fariyaz2005/customer-behavior-data-analysis-SQL-Python-PowerBI.git
   ```
2. Load the CSV file into your SQL environment or read directly in Python.
3. Run the SQL scripts to create tables or extract data.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells to perform the analysis.
5. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view and interact with dashboards.

## Analysis Highlights
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Customer purchasing trends
- Product-wise and category-wise insights
- Visualization of key metrics such as sales, purchase frequency, and customer behavior
- Interactive dashboard in Power BI for easy exploration

## Future Enhancements
- Add machine learning models for customer segmentation
- Build predictive analytics such as churn prediction
- Automate the ETL workflow
- Create a unified reporting framework
